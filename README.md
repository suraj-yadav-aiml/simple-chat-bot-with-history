## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system.
2. **Ollama**: Install and set up Ollama for LangChain.

### How to Install Ollama

1. **Download Ollama**:  
   Visit the official [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/) and follow the instructions to download and install Ollama on your system.

2. **Start the Ollama Server**:  
   Once installed, start the Ollama server:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
   By default, the server will run at `http://localhost:11434`.

3. **Download a Model**:  
   Use the Ollama CLI to download a model. For example:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```
   This ensures the model is available for the chatbot.



## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suraj-yadav-aiml/simple-chat-bot-with-history
cd simple-chat-bot-with-history
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure the Project

Update `chat_assistant/config.py` with the necessary settings:
- `BASE_URL`: Ensure it points to your Ollama server (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`).
- `MODEL`: Specify the name of the model you pulled (e.g., `llama3.2`).
- `DB_CONNECTION`: SQLite connection string (e.g., `sqlite:///chat_history.db`).

### Step 4: Run the Application

Navigate to the `streamlit_app/` directory and start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser

## Usage

1. Enter your **User ID** in the sidebar.
2. Start chatting with the AI by typing messages in the input box.
3. View the chat history or start a new conversation using the sidebar controls.

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for enhancing the chatbot application:

1. **Advanced Model Selection**:  
   Add a feature in the sidebar to allow users to select from multiple AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 2) dynamically during runtime.

2. **Export Chat History**:  
   Enable users to download their chat history as a text or PDF file for reference.

3. **Rich Media Responses**:  
   Enhance the assistant's responses to include images, graphs, or other media formats when applicable.

4. **Customizable Assistant Personality**:  
   Allow users to choose or configure the assistant's tone and personality (e.g., professional, friendly, humorous).

5. **Voice Input and Output**:  
    Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities to enable voice-based interaction with the chatbot.
